# BTT Scripts

My pride are the scripts I have made for controlling media playback on my Mac.

- [`play media`](./applescript/media/playmedia.applescript) checks for currently playing media and playpauses depending on different factors, such as which application is in the foreground and what priority it has (Spotify is #1)

- [`handle media`](./applescript/media/handlemedia.applescript) also figures out what is playing, but brings the respective app to the foreground or pauses if that app already is foremost

## btt-controllers

Controllers for BetterTouchTool widgets. Provides hooks for various services that run in the background.

The source of the included service binaries can be found at [andrewchidden/btt-services](https://github.com/andrewchidden/btt-services).

# Service Hooks

Pre-built binaries and controller scripts for these `btt-service` instances:

- `volume-service`
- `eventkit-service`
- `controlstrip-service`

# Timer App

Simple single-instance timer for the Touch Bar.

# Git Diff

Git diff statistics for a configured working directory.

# Tests

The project uses [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) (Bash Automated Testing System) for unit testing shell script logic. The `.bats` test files are located in the `./tests` directory. The Bats binary is not included.

Use `$ bats ./tests` from the project root to run all unit tests, or `$ bats ./tests/a-test-file.bats` to run a particular test file.

- **@warning** Bats cannot handle arbitrary functions when using the built-in `setup` and `teardown` test hooks. As a result, all test cases need to manually call `set_up` and `tear_down`.

# Contributing

Contributions welcomed. Some ground rules:

- Please try to follow the style of the codebase which takes inspiration from [Google’s shell style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml).
- Add unit tests for all core controller functionality. See the **Tests** section for more information.
