# Welcome to HydroTouch! 💧

This is a heavily personalized and customized ~~preset based on~~
extension for the amazing [AquaTouch](https://community.folivora.ai/c/setup-preset-sharing/aquatouch) [Preset](https://github.com/yuuiko/AquaTouch) for [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai) by [@yuuiko](https://github.com/yuuiko).

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/wiki) for more info!

# [Releases](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/releases)

This is the first release, to install, just [download the preset files](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/releases/tag/v0.1) files and open them with BTT.

# [Installation](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/wiki/Installation)

Due to the existing limitations of updating presets in BTT, I have reworked HydroTouch to function as an extension layer on top of AquaTouch. Nevertheless there are some changes needed to achieve the setup I prefer. I am beginning to document the necessary modifications in comments within HydroTouch where possible and will try to list the most important ones [in the wiki](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/wiki).

# BTT Setup

- [Import duplicate presets](https://community.folivora.ai/t/cant-import-a-preset-without-replacing/10455/4)
